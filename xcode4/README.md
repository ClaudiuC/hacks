## Solarized Color Theme for Xcode4
#### [Solarized Color Theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized)

## Installation
This is pretty basic. You have a couple of options:

* If you're on a Mac:
  * Run install.sh and see the miracle unfold OR
  * Manually copy the files to
  _/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes_ 
* If you're on Windows:
  * You'll have to figure it out and / or send me a diff for install.sh to
    support it.

The new color profiles will be visible at _Xcode > Preferences > Fonts &
Colors_. If not, you probably need to restart your IDE.
